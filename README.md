# Kitcheneesta

Initially developed for the 2015 TiE Young Entrepreneurs program, Kitcheneesta is an Android application that allows the Kitcheneesta bakery customers to customise and order cakes for delivery via a simple and clean user interface. 

This project helped me gain familiarity with implementing complex layouts, list adapters and GridViews.
